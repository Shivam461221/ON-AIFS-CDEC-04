✅ Step 1 – Create a GitHub account (if you don’t have one)

Go to https://github.com

Click Sign up and create your account.

Verify your email.

✅ Step 2 – Create a new repository on GitHub

Log into GitHub.

Click on the + icon on the top right → New repository.

Fill in the repository details:

Repository name: e.g., my-website

Description (optional): e.g., "My website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap"

Public → anyone can see it

Initialize this repository with a README → leave it unchecked if you want to push your existing folder

Click Create repository.

You'll be redirected to a page with instructions on how to push your code.

✅ Step 3 – Install Git on your computer (if not installed)
For Windows:

Download Git from https://git-scm.com/download/win

Install with default options.


Verify by running:

git --version

✅ Step 4 – Configure Git

After installing, set your Git identity:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"


This will associate your commits with your GitHub account.

✅ Step 5 – Initialize Git in your project folder

Open Command Prompt / Terminal.

Navigate to your project folder. Example:

cd path/to/your/website


(You can drag and drop the folder into the terminal in some systems.)

Initialize Git:

git init


This creates a .git folder and starts tracking your project.

✅ Step 6 – Add files to the staging area
git add .


This adds all files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.) to be tracked by Git.

✅ Step 7 – Commit the files
git commit -m "Initial commit"


This saves the current state of your project.

✅ Step 8 – Link your local project with the GitHub repository

You’ll now link your local folder to the GitHub repository you created.

Copy the repository URL from GitHub. It will look like:

https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git


Run the following command in the terminal:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/my-website.git

✅ Step 9 – Push your files to GitHub
git push -u origin master
